# lanthanide-ligand-logK_predictions
Dataset containing the predicted binding affinities of ~77 million compounds in the pubchem database with lanthanide ions. These logKs correspond to 1:1 M-L complex (i.e., logK = [ML]/[M][L]). The values are predicted using an ADABOOST regression model with decision trees as the base regressor.
